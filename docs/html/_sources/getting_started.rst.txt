Getting started
===============
It's worth to mention, at this point Certificate Authority should already create git repository to keep users public keys.
At first use, regardless of command used, user is asked to provide link to the git repository.
Before encrypting messages, files and any other confidential stuff, there has to be created at least one *identity*
which is used to sign gpg messages.
Create *identity* with:

.. code-block:: shell

    gpki identity <name> [--email <email>] [--description <description>]

Apart from created gpg public/private key pair, new pull request to master branch has been opened. In order to receive
messages from other users, your *identity* has to be approved by CA and merged to master branch.

To source all available recipients from repository, use:

.. code-block:: shell

    gpki update

Encrypt message or file with:

.. code-block:: shell

    gpki encrypt [--all/-a] [--input/-i <input_path>] [--output/-o <output_path>]

Decrypt message with:

.. code-block:: shell

    gpki decrypt [--input/-i <input_path>] [--output/-o <output_path>] [--update/-u]
